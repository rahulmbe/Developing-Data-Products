========================


This apps facilitates the use to interactively regress mpg on another 
variable of the mtcars dataset. You can for example select the variable
 wt (weight) which will result in a regression of mpg on weight. 
After selecting your variable at the right a plot is shown of these 
two variables including the regression line through these points.
 Under this plot the coefficients of the regression are given. 
Next you can change the value of mpg in the slide bar.
 The model is next applied to this value to predict the value of 
the variable you selected for this value of mpg. In the plot this is also
 seen by two lines and the red dot (the prediction). Furthermore it 
must be noted that the coloring of the data points is done according
 to the cyl variable, the number of cylinders. Have fun!
